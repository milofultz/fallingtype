Falling Words - Typing Game
---

As the words fall, you have to type it. If you mistype, you are given an
added random character to the beginning of the word.

I bought a split keyboard and I needed to create a game that got me to practice
typing on it. I thought a good way to go about this would be to make my own
typing game with Python. I learned about Blessed and realized this might be
the easiest way to implement it. 

Future Implementations

* Multiple falling words - Attack them in order
* Difficulty - A level system that one can choose
* Colors
* Sound?
